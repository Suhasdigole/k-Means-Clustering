# k-Means-Clustering

K-Means Clustering:

Logic: K-means clustering partitions data into 
𝑘
k clusters by minimizing the variance within each cluster.
Description: The algorithm assigns data points to the nearest cluster centroid, recalculates centroids, and iterates this process until the assignments no longer change.

Practical examples:
Eg 1- Segmenting website visitors into different groups based on their browsing behavior for personalized marketing.
Eg 2- Grouping similar products together based on features like price, category, and user ratings for inventory management.

In the above code we use the K-means clustering algorithm, to determine different groups of people depending on their salaries.
